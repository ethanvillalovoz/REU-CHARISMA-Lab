Project Name: Scary Triangles and Friendly Arcs: Developing Geometric Features for Multi-Robot Expressive Motion

Advisor: Dr. Heather Knight

Mentor: Alexandra Bacula

Contributors: Ethan Villalovoz, Alexandra Bacula

# Project Description 

The goal of this project is to make robots more approachable to humans. One aspect is how people perceive robots through different geometric formations. I focused on developing geometric features for multi-robot expressive motion to enhance the character and intelligence of the robots. I conducted literature reviews to establish a theoretical foundation, exploring the correlation between geometric shapes and human emotional responses in human-robot interaction. I implemented a robust Python script for calculating geometric formation ending positions, ensuring seamless communication with the Pioneer 3DX robot. I designed a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the script, enhancing accessibility and facilitating efficient command-line interaction. I actively participated in the design of two studies, providing valuable insights into how geometric formations influence human perception of robots. I wrote up my work which was used in the publication of this work.
