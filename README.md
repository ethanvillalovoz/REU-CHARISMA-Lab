## Introduction

Welcome to the REU-CHARISMA-Lab repository! This repository contains the work completed during my Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Oregon State University's CHARISMA Robotics Laboratory. 

## Project Description 

The goal of this project was to explore how geometric formations influence human perception of robots and develop geometric features for multi-robot expressive motion to enhance human-robot interaction. I conducted literature reviews, implemented Python scripts for calculating geometric formations, and participated in the design and execution of two studies. Additionally, I contributed to writing up our findings, which were published at the 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).
